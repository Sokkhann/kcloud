    {
      "question": "What is a Virtual Machine (VM) and what can I use it for?",
      "answer": "A Virtual Machine (VM) is a fully isolated computing environment that runs on top of physical hardware. It allows you to deploy applications, host websites, run databases, build development environments, or support enterprise workloads without managing physical servers. Our platform provides flexible VM sizes, automated scaling options, and backup integrations to support a wide range of business needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How fast can I deploy a new VM?",
      "answer": "VM deployment typically takes less than one minute. Once you select your operating system, resources, and network configuration, our system automatically provisions the VM, attaches storage, and configures networking. You can access the VM immediately via SSH or Remote Console. Larger VM templates or custom images may take slightly longer depending on size."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I upgrade or downgrade my VM resources later?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can scale your VM at any time. You may increase CPU, RAM, and storage capacity based on your workload requirements. Most upgrades can be done live without shutting down the VM, although some operating systems may require a brief reboot. Scaling down is also supported for certain configurations, allowing you to reduce costs when traffic is low."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer automated backups for VMs?",
      "answer": "Yes. Our VM service includes optional automated backups with daily, weekly, and custom schedules. Backups are stored in a separate, durable storage system to ensure recovery even in case of hardware failure. You can restore a full VM or recover individual data volumes directly from the management console."
    },
    {
      "question": "How secure are my Virtual Machines?",
      "answer": "All VMs run on isolated compute nodes with strict hypervisor-level security. Your data is protected with encrypted storage, firewall rules, private networking, and access control policies. You can also configure security groups, SSH key-based authentication, and IP whitelisting to further secure your environment. Our platform continuously monitors for unauthorized activity to ensure your workloads remain safe."

   "vnfFAQ": [
    {
      "question": "What is a Virtual Network Function (VNF) and why should I use it?",
      "answer": "A Virtual Network Function (VNF) is a software-based network service that runs on virtualized hardware instead of dedicated physical appliances. VNFs can include firewalls, load balancers, routers, and intrusion detection systems. Using VNFs allows you to quickly deploy, scale, and update network services with reduced hardware costs and simplified management."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can I deploy a new VNF?",
      "answer": "Deployment of a new VNF typically takes just a few minutes. Once you select the type of network function and configure the required parameters, our system automatically provisions the virtual instance, integrates it into your network, and applies the necessary policies. This rapid deployment helps accelerate network service delivery."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can VNFs be scaled or updated without downtime?",
      "answer": "Yes, VNFs are designed for dynamic scaling. You can increase or decrease resources such as CPU, memory, and bandwidth based on network demand. Most updates and patches can be applied live without service interruption, although certain major configuration changes may require a brief restart depending on the VNF type."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer monitoring and automated management for VNFs?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Our platform provides real-time monitoring, performance analytics, and automated management tools for VNFs. You can track resource utilization, network throughput, and health status, as well as configure alerts for anomalies. Automated scaling and policy adjustments help maintain optimal performance without manual intervention."
    },
    {
      "question": "How secure are VNFs in your platform?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Can I create snapshots while the VM is running?",
      "answer": "Yes, most platforms support live snapshots, allowing you to capture the VM state without shutting it down. This ensures minimal disruption to services while creating a recovery point."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are snapshots incremental or full copies?",
      "answer": "Most systems use incremental snapshots to save storage space and reduce backup time. Only changes since the last snapshot are stored, while the first snapshot is usually a full copy of the volume or VM."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long can I keep snapshots?",
      "answer": "Snapshot retention depends on your platform policies. You can keep snapshots short-term for quick rollbacks or long-term as part of disaster recovery plans. Automated deletion policies can help manage storage efficiently."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I restore individual files from a snapshot?",
      "answer": "Some platforms allow granular restore from snapshots, enabling recovery of individual files or volumes rather than restoring the entire VM. This makes snapshots very flexible for data recovery scenarios."
    },
